# Sales Forecasting with LSTM

## Project Overview
This project involves forecasting sales using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The analysis is documented in the Jupyter Notebook `sales_forecasting_lstm.ipynb`.

## Files
- `sales_forecasting_lstm.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the analysis and forecasting models.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical sales data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
4. **Modeling with LSTM**: Applying LSTM neural networks to forecast sales.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models.
